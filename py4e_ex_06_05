6.5 Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to extract the number at the end of the line below. 
Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out.


Solution:

text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475"
first = text.find('0')
ans = text[first-1:]
rans = float(ans)
print(rans)
