8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split() method. 
The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. 
When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in python sort() order as shown in the desired output.
You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt

Solution:

fname = input("Enter file name: ")    #The first line prompts the user to enter a file name and stores it in a variable called "fname".
fh = open(fname)                      # The second line opens the file specified by the "fname" variable and assigns the file handle to the variable "fh".
data=[]                               # The third line creates an empty list called "data".
for each in fh:                       # The next lines make up a for loop that iterates over each line in the file specified by the "fh" variable.
    words=each.split()                # Inside the for loop, each line is split into a list of words using the .split() method.
    for word in words:                # This is followed by another for loop that iterates over the list of words
        if word not in data:          # Inside the second for loop, a check is made to see if the current word is already present in the "data" list.
            data.append(word)         # If the word is not in the "data" list, it is added to the list using the append() method.
print(sorted(data))                   # Finally, the sorted() function is used to sort the "data" list and it is printed.
